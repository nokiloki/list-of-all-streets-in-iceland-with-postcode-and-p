List of all street names in Iceland, the postcode for the street, and place (municipiality). Combines two datasets from the Iceland Post Authorities and scratches an itch.

Items:
pnr = postcode
gata_nf = street name (nominative case)
gata_thgf = street name (objective case)
stadur = place name (municipality)
